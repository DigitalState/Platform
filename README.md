The Platform repository provides a Docker container, with Ansible pre-installed, to help orchestrate instances of the DigitalState Application. It comes with a wide variety of **Ansible playbooks** to help the developer manage local and remote deployments; from sandbox to production.

This is the central repository and starting point for developers.

> :warning: The __develop__ branch of Platform represents the latest development efforts and should be considered experimental. For a stable release, consult the [releases page](https://github.com/DigitalState/Platform/releases).
